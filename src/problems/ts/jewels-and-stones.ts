// 771. Jewels and Stones
// You're given strings jewels representing the types of stones that are jewels, and stones representing the stones you have. Each character in stones is a type of stone you have. You want to know how many of the stones you have are also jewels.

// Letters are case sensitive, so "a" is considered a different type of stone from "A".

// Example 1:

// Input: jewels = "aA", stones = "aAAbbbb"
// Output: 3
// Example 2:

// Input: jewels = "z", stones = "ZZ"
// Output: 0

// Constraints:

// 1 <= jewels.length, stones.length <= 50
// jewels and stones consist of only English letters.
// All the characters of jewels are unique.

function numJewelsInStones(jewels: string, stones: string): number {
  return (stones.match(new RegExp(`[!${jewels}]`, 'g')) || []).length;
}

console.log(numJewelsInStones('aA', 'aAAbbbb')); // 3
console.log(numJewelsInStones('z', 'ZZ')); // 0
