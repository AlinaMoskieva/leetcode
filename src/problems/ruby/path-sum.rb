# 112. Path Sum
# Easy
# Given the root of a binary tree and an integer targetSum, return true if the tree has a root-to-leaf path such that adding up all the values along the path equals targetSum.

# A leaf is a node with no children.

# Example 1:

# Input: root = [5,4,8,11,null,13,4,7,2,null,null,null,1], targetSum = 22
# Output: true
# Explanation: The root-to-leaf path with the target sum is shown.
# Example 2:

# Input: root = [1,2,3], targetSum = 5
# Output: false
# Explanation: There two root-to-leaf paths in the tree:
# (1 --> 2): The sum is 3.
# (1 --> 3): The sum is 4.
# There is no root-to-leaf path with sum = 5.
# Example 3:

# Input: root = [], targetSum = 0
# Output: false
# Explanation: Since the tree is empty, there are no root-to-leaf paths.

# Constraints:

# The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 5000].
# -1000 <= Node.val <= 1000
# -1000 <= targetSum <= 1000

# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode
#     attr_accessor :val, :left, :right
#     def initialize(val = 0, left = nil, right = nil)
#         @val = val
#         @left = left
#         @right = right
#     end
# end
# @param {TreeNode} root
# @param {Integer} target_sum
# @return {Boolean}
# Complexity T: O(n), S: O(n)
def has_path_sum(root, target_sum)
  return false unless root

  answer = false
  current_sum = target_sum - root.val

  return answer = true if current_sum == 0 && root.right.nil? && root.left.nil?

  answer ||= has_path_sum(root.left, current_sum) unless root.left.nil?
  answer ||= has_path_sum(root.right, current_sum) unless root.right.nil?
